# Product Requirements Document

**Product:** TruFit Bodamma  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Platform:** Android (Flutter)  
**Status:** Private personal release  
**Owner:** Shravan Kumar Vasala  
**Primary user:** Bodamma (sister)  
**Last updated:** 2026-08-02  

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product summary

TruFit Bodamma is a **private, local-first personal fitness coach app**. It helps one person follow a structured workout phase, stick to a calorie-aware meal plan, track daily habits and body metrics, and see progress over time — without accounts, cloud sync, or ads.

### 1.2 Problem

Generic fitness apps are noisy, privacy-invasive, and not tailored to a single coached plan. Bodamma needs a simple daily companion that:

- Shows **today’s workout and meals** clearly
- Makes logging **fast and encouraging**
- Keeps **all personal data on her phone**
- Lets her brother (coach) ship updates via APK / backup restore without building a backend

### 1.3 Goals

| Goal | Success signal |
|------|----------------|
| Daily adherence | User opens app and logs meals / habits / workout most training days |
| Clarity | Today’s plan is obvious within one glance on Home |
| Privacy | No account; data stays on device; exportable by user |
| Continuity | Encrypted backup/restore survives phone change |
| Motivation | Daily score + weekly summary + physique photos reinforce consistency |

### 1.4 Non-goals (v1)

- Multi-user accounts, social feed, or coach dashboard in the cloud
- iOS / web production release
- Public Play Store listing or monetization
- Real-time wearable write-back beyond Health Connect read
- Full nutrition database / barcode shopping features

---

## 2. Users & personas

### 2.1 Primary — Bodamma (athlete / trainee)

- Follows a coached **Phase 1 (8 weeks)** workout and **Balanced Non-Veg** meal plan (~1397 kcal)
- Wants low-friction daily check-ins (meals, water, sleep, steps, workout)
- May use Health Connect / phone step sensors
- Prefers dark, clear UI; not a power-user of fitness SaaS

### 2.2 Secondary — Coach (Shravan)

- Seeds and updates workout/meal plans
- Builds and sideloads APKs
- Reviews progress via shared screenshots / exported backups when needed
- Does **not** need remote admin access in v1

---

## 3. Product principles

1. **Local-first** — Hive on device is the system of record. No backend.
2. **Privacy by default** — Outbound network only for Gemini (optional AI meals/coach) and YouTube (form videos). Health Connect is on-device.
3. **One day, one job** — Home is the daily cockpit; Progress is history; Profile is setup.
4. **Clear source of truth** — Avoid dual flags that disagree (see §6.2).
5. **Encourage, don’t punish** — Rest days count as complete for scoring; finish-early is allowed.

---

## 4. Scope & platform

| Item | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| OS | Android (minSdk 26+) |
| Distribution | Sideload APK (profile/release via local scripts) |
| Offline | Core logging works offline; AI / YouTube need network |
| Auth | None |
| Storage | Hive + local files (photos, backups) |
| Optional integrations | Android Health Connect, Gemini API key (user-provided) |

---

## 5. Information architecture

### 5.1 Navigation

| Tab / area | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Home** | Today (or selected day): score, metrics, habits, meals, workout entry, coach notes |
| **Progress** | Charts, weekly summary, phase progress, PRs / trends |
| **Profile** | Edit profile, manage plans, habits, reminders, theme, backup/restore, Health Connect / AI settings |

### 5.2 Key flows

1. Onboarding → profile + goals + optional Health Connect + optional Gemini key  
2. Daily: open Home → log weight/sleep/steps → check habits → log meals → do workout → Finish  
3. Progress review: weekly summary / charts / physique compare  
4. Phone change: export encrypted ZIP → restore on new device

## 7. Data & privacy requirements

### 7.1 Storage

- All primary data in local Hive boxes (profile, daily logs, exercise logs, meals, habits, photos metadata, plans, etc.).
- Schema migrations must run safely on upgrade.
- Gemini API key never written to plain Hive JSON export without secure storage rules.

### 7.2 Source-of-truth rules (non-negotiable)

| Concept | Source of truth |
|---------|-----------------|
| Exercise / section completion | `ExerciseLog` |
| Day-level Finish | `DailyLog.workoutCompleted` (+ auto when all sections logged) |
| Rest-day “done” for scoring | `WorkoutCompletion` helpers |
| Steps / sleep values | `DailyLog` fields; optional `stepsSource` / `sleepSource` |

### 7.3 Privacy

- No accounts, analytics SDKs, or remote database in v1.
- User can delete app data by uninstall / clear storage.
- Backup password/encryption required for portable ZIP.

---

## 8. UX requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| UX-1 | Dark theme must keep text, fields, FABs, and sheets readable (no white-on-white) |
| UX-2 | Modal sheets that must clear bottom nav use root navigator |
| UX-3 | Home first viewport: day context, score/metrics, then habits/meals/workout — avoid cluttered promo chrome |
| UX-4 | Logging dialogs (weight, sleep, steps, habits) are quick and forgiving |
| UX-5 | Copy is personal and clear (e.g. “Today’s Meals”, “Balanced Non-Veg Plan”) |

---

## 9. Non-functional requirements

| Area | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Performance | Home and day switch feel instant on mid-range Android |
| Reliability | Logging never depends on network |
| Security | Encrypt backups; secure API key storage |
| Maintainability | Riverpod layers: models → repositories → providers → UI |
| Testability | Unit tests for score, workout completion, backup, PR helpers |
| Delivery | Local scripts: `scripts/build_and_install.ps1`, optional keystore generation |

---

## 10. Seeded content (v1 defaults)

| Asset | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Workout | Phase 1 (8 Weeks) — weekday sections with YouTube form links; rest day |
| Meals | Balanced Non-Veg Plan — ~1397 kcal across 4 slots |
| Habits | Sleep, walk/steps, water (and user-custom) |
| Targets | Calories ~1397; protein/carbs/fat defaults on profile |

---

## 11. Acceptance criteria (v1 release)

1. Fresh install → onboarding → seeded plans appear on Home.  
2. User can log a full training day (habits + meals + all sections) and see score rise.  
3. Rest day awards full workout points without logging exercises.  
4. Finish early sets day complete and awards workout points.  
5. Health Connect steps appear after grant without requiring a fresh “Sync” every cold start when previously connected.  
6. Backup ZIP restores plans, logs, and photos on a clean install.  
7. Dark theme: profile edit, manage habits, weight/sleep/steps dialogs remain legible.  
8. No crash on airplane mode for core logging.

---

## 12. Risks & constraints

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Health Connect permission flakiness after process death | Persist connection flag; probe read; refresh on resume |
| Dual completion semantics | Documented SoT + `WorkoutCompletion` helpers |
| Gemini key / cost / network | Optional feature; offline logging unaffected |
| Sideload-only distribution | Document install + USB debugging for coach |
| Single-user product drift | Keep scope personal; avoid multi-tenant features |

---

## 13. Future considerations (post-v1)

- Coach share link / read-only progress export without full backup  
- Plan editor UI for brother without editing JSON seeds  
- iOS if needed later  
- Deeper sleep/HR from Health Connect  
- Smarter coach notes from weekly adherence  

---

## 14. Appendix — Daily score formula

```
habits   = (habitsDone / habitsCount) * 40
workouts = (sectionsDone / sectionsCount) * 30
           OR 30 on rest day
           OR 30 if Finish-early flag set
meals    = (slotsLogged / planSlots) * 20
steps    = min(1, steps / stepsTarget) * 10   // only if steps/walk habit exists

total    = round( (sum earned / sum max) * 100 )
```

Future dates → `0`.
